               Is NOT a Secret everyone dislikes the need to progress through a series of interfaces to Submit an Order. It confuse customers, consumes time, difficult to make multiple orders, causes long wait lines to use the machine during high demand hours and more.
          <br>
          <br>
           The ATM and Vending Machines industry is very aware of this issue. Big players in the industry have already began to employ the most minimalist UI/UX designs possible in their Machines to reduce the number of interfaces a customer must go through in order to Submit an order.

                At Metro stations is actually much easier and faster to buy a Metro pass via the Teller in the Station then via the Vending Machine at the Station. How Come???
