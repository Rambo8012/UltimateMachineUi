          <h2>Functional  Design</h2>
          <p>The design is aesthetically appealing but that is NOT the important part of this interface. It is the Functional Design that gets the credit of enabling an authenticated customers to submit his transaction in an average time of 5 seconds or less, 40-90% faster resulting in a dramatic alleviation to wait lines during high demand hours. This functional design multiplies the value of the ATM machine by x5. </p>

          <h2>Minimalistic Design</h2>
          <p>Sections in today's ATM machines are well Known by banking consumers. Sadly each section is displayed to the customer as he progress through a series of interfaces. The Ultimate UI for ATM Machines is an all-in-one interface where these well known sections are contained within rows. It is 'Next Row' means 'Next Section' because Simple is the new luxury. Customer won't need to progress through a series of interfaces to submit a basic transaction.   </p>
       </div>

        <div class="col-md-4">
          <h2>Aesthetic Design</h2>
          <p>Customize it to feature the brand colors of your organization to express your culture to your customers, perhaps a brand logo as shadow in the background will also be great. Its Sections(rows) could optionally be colored differently so customers can easily tell them apart or simply for aesthetic purposes also visual effects could be used to hint the customer what to do. Notice the prototype above featuring trademark colors and logos of well known banks.</p>

  <p> To alleviate wait lines at ATM machines you would: <br>
  <b>(a)</b>Deploy more ATM machines.  
  <br><b>(b)</b>Deploy the <b>Ultimate Machine Ui</b> in your machines.
  <br><b>(c)</b>Both

      </p>
      <br>
        <p> If the customer experience of the ATM machine is made Simpler customers will be able to self-assist themselves much faster. The Ultimate Machine Ui is the best solution to treat the wait time during high demand hours.
        </p>

      <br>

      <p>
<i> With the Ultimate UI it will be so simple and fun to submit transactions that customers might prefer it over submitting transactions via their banking mobile Application for a later pick up at an ATM machine.</i>

</p>

<br>



<p>
<b>QUICK Cash options, where are they? </b><br>
  They're gone....  first, because they don’t always meet customer needs which  results in the customer ultimately manually specifying the desired value and second, because with the  Ultimate UI customers will be able to seamlessly specify a desired amount using the onscreen linear keypad or machine keypad.
</p>


<br>

<p>
Why the user experience at the ATM machine has to always feel like that of a first-time user when  90% of customers are NOT first-timers and have probably been using ATMs for decades by now. The ATM Interface has to be redefined and simplified to something non-first timers love which at the same time is friendly and simple for first timers.  
</p>
  
<br>


<p>
A key advantage of the Ultimate Machine UI interface is that it eliminates the need for the customer to progress through a series of interfaces in order to submit a simple transaction.  This is a great feature because the customer  won’t need to navigate backward /forward through a series of interfaces in order to make a correction or verify his entries. An all-in-one interface is a lot more friendlier then a series of interfaces.
</p>

<br>

<br>

<p>
Don’t let it's simple appeal dismiss you. It is actually as capable and useful as current ATM User interfaces or more. 
</p>

<br>

<p>
What makes it The Ultimate User Interface is that it the simplest, friendliest, fastest and useful a user machines UI can be.

The rushy lifestyle of cities demands innovations that aim to get things done faster because Time is valuable (A 15 minute wait line at an ATM is a punishment no one deserves).

</p>

<br>


<p>
One solution to long lines at ATM machines would be deploying more machines to meet demand. This is NOT cost effective at all, also deploying hundreds or thousands of new machines is no easy task it would take months perhaps years to achieve,  by that time customers would have suffered enough to consider changing to another bank with faster service.
</p>


<br>

<br>


<p>
A smarter and effective solution to long lines at ATM machines would be a new User Interface that redefines the customer experience at the machine so authenticated customers become able to seamlessly submit their transactions in an average time of  5 seconds or less. This is a solution that can be deployed in less than  24 hours. 
</p>



<br>


<p>


The Ultimate machine UI is a solution  that multiples the value of a particular ATM machine by 5x (estimated). The Ultimate UI is a great solution for alleviating long wait lines at machines during high demand hours and also is friendlier and smoother then current ATMs User interfaces.
