           After the customer Authenticates himself he will be presented with this All-in-one User Interface which does NOT requires customers to progress through a series of interfaces to submit a transaction.
           <br>
           <br>
              Sections are organized into Rows. The Customer simply needs to <b>Select the desired Option in each Row</b>.
              The Options selected by the customer <b>stay highlighted</b> so the customer can verify his order before submitting it.
                <br>
                <br>

              <b>Each Account displays its Current Balance</b> to the customer. <b>To view the recent activity</b> of an Account just double tap the desired Account. 

              <br>
              <br>
               <b>Classic Appeal:</b> Ensures customers instantly adapt to it.
               

              <br>
              <br>

              Because <b>Fast Cash</b> options don't match everyone's needs, the Ultimate Machine UI's design has replaced <b>Fast Cash</b> options with a <b>Linear-Number-Keypad</b> as it offers a more complete experience without sacrificing simplicity. Customers will use it to specify Withdraw, Transfer, Send, Bill Pay and other amounts. Sending money and paying bills from an ATM machine is now easier then ever.

    
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>ATM Model 2</b> sacrifices a bit of the classic appearance to combine the sections "Services" and "Accounts" into a single Row. So the customer Selects both with the press of a single button.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Bill Denomination</b>, a feature offered by modern machines, is simpler then ever.

          <p>Making the native Language the default language of the machine will save 90% of the customers from having to select a language since most customers speak or understand the native language of the city/country. The minority who doesn't speaks or understands the native language will, however, need to select the desired language in the first Row.</p>

                    <p>One particular UIUX design won't meet the needs and preferences of all users. A modular design adapts to meet the needs of the customers. The end user can also customize it to meet his needs and preferences. The  configuration end users set on the mobile application could be the same configuration they find at the machine so their overall experience is 95-100% consistent. </p>
