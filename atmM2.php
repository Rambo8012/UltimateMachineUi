           After the customer Authenticates himself he will be presented with this All-in-one User Interface which does NOT requires customers to progress through a series of interfaces to submit a transaction.
           <br>
           <br>
              Sections are organized into Rows. The Customer simply needs to <b>Select the desired Option in each Row</b>.
              The Options selected by the customer <b>stay highlighted</b> so the customer can verify his order before submitting it.
                <br>
                <br>

              <b>Each Account displays its Current Balance</b> to the customer. <b>To view the recent activity</b> of an Account just double tap the desired Account. 

              <br>
              <br>
               <b>Classic Appeal:</b> Ensures customers instantly adapt to it.
               

              <br>
              <br>

              Because <b>Fast Cash</b> options don't match everyone's needs, the Ultimate Machine UI's design has replaced <b>Fast Cash</b> options with a <b>Linear-Number-Keypad</b> as it offers a more complete experience without sacrificing simplicity. Customers will use it to specify Withdraw, Transfer, Send, Bill Pay and other amounts. Sending money and paying bills from an ATM machine is now easier then ever.

    
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>ATM Model 2</b> sacrifices a bit of the classic appearance to combine the sections "Services" and "Accounts" into a single Row. So the customer Selects both with the press of a single button.
              <br>
              <br>
              <b>Bill Denomination</b>, a feature offered by modern machines, is simpler then ever.
