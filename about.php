                    The project Ultimate Machine Ui is a portfolio of <b>Single Faceted UI/UX designs </b> for everyday self-service machines and mobile applications in our lives, such as bank ATM machines, Ticket vending machines in the metro, Gas Stations pumps, Vehicle Rental self-service machines, as well as for the mobile applications for Bank, Metro tickert purchase, buying fuel at gas stations and more.  These are <b>worlds first.</b> 
                    </p>
<br>

                     <p>
                         This project is the beginning of a <b>new much simpler era</b> where customers wont ever have to progress throught a series of interfaces to get what they need at ATMs, vending Machines and a great number of everiday mobile applications.
                     </p>
<br>

                    <p>
                    Because <b>innovation is about making life simpler</b> we can anticipate a non-distant future where single faceted UI/UX designs will become a mandatory standard in ATMs, Vending Machines and other everyday devices and mobile applications. 
                    </p>

<br>
                     <p>
                     The single faceted UI/UX designs in Ultimate Machine UIs portfolio all follow common concept:  Sections are organized into Rows, each featuring a number of options for the customer to select the desired one.
                     </p>
<br>
                     <p>
                         Customers will also, for the first time in history, find a consitent experience in their Bank ATMs and mobile app, their city ticket vending machines and mobile app, their gas stations pumps and mobile app.
                     </p>

                        This minimalist concept ensures a very simple, intuitive, fluent user experience for customers of any age, gender, religion, etc. It is so Intuitive it does not even needs to guide the customer through the process of submitting an order.
                    </p>
<br>
    
                     <p>
                     The goal of the project Ultimate Machine Ui is to make the customer experience in everyday self-service machines and mobile applications as simple and efficient as possible. The UI/UX design in a machine or mobile application is more then 90% responsible for the customer experience.
                     </p>

                    <p>
                        
<br>
                </p>
        
                    The Goal of this project is also to create a universal ecosystem where Bank ATMs, Metro ticket vendingmachines, gas pumps, banking apps, transportation apps and others have the same user experience (UX) so that local and foreign customers don't have to learn how to use the machine at every bank or train-bus station around the world.      
                </p>

<br>


         <p>The Ultimate Machine UI concept and UI/UX designs are <b>Patent pending.</b> They bring some serious enhancing to the customer experience at the machine to such a level that the Ultimate Machine UI also happens to be the greatest solution to long wait lines at self-service machines during high demand hours. 
               <br>
               <br>

         This design concept is a game changer for many important and prestigious financial, transportation and petrochemical entities who are always no look for innovations that help them better serve their customers.</p>
