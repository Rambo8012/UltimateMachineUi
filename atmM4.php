                    <p> This <b>single-faceted</b> user interface consist of Sections organized into Rows, the customer simply needs to select the desired option in each Row. This UI/UX concept marks the beggining of a new era where customers wont ever need to progress through a series of interfaces to submit an order. A Linear flow user experience is <b>universally intuitive and inclusive.</b> Grandma will love it.</p>

          <p>At self-services machines such as ATM machines this intuitive UI/UX design will help customers self-assist themselves seamlessly and faster. If the customer is withdrawing cash at the machine via the banking app then it will be even faster because the experience is not only cardless but also touchless.</p>

                   <h3> To Favor the Majority</h3>

          <p>Making the native Language the default language of the machine will save 90% of the customers from having to select a language since most customers speak or understand the native language of the city/country. The minority who doesn't speaks or understands the native language will, however, need to select the desired language in the first Row.</p>

                    <p> Account buttons <b>display their current Balance </b>, and optionally the amount of the latest transactions or current value in other currency type so the customer is not required to make an extra step or look somewhere else just to know his accounts balances.

                   <h3>Linear-Number-Keypad</h3>

                    <p> The linear number keypad in this UIUX design does not limits the customer to pre-defined quick cash options such as $20 , $40, $80, $100 etc. It <b>offers a more complete and versatile experience</b>. Customers will use it to seamlessly specify the amount of their Withdraws, Transfers, Payments, Money to Send and more. Its Linear minimalist appearance earned it a fixed spot in the screen and therefore it does not needs to be progressively disclosed to the user. Also having the number pad in the screen saves users from having to take their sight from the screen which would disrupt the flow.</p>

                   <h3> Modular Design</h3>

                    <p> One particular UIUX design won't meet the needs and preferences of all users. A modular design adapts to meet the needs of the customers. The end user can also customize it to meet his needs and preferences. The  configuration end users set on the mobile application could be the same configuration they find at the machine so their overall experience is 95-100% consistent. </p>
